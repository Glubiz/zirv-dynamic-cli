//! zirv's own harness-neutral command safety policy (issue #83).
//!
//! Every harness zirv wraps has its own, incompatible way of deciding
//! whether a command is safe to run unattended (claude's `permissions.allow`/
//! `permissions.deny` globs plus hooks; codex's `--sandbox`/`--ask-for-
//! approval` flags plus `.rules` execpolicy files). This module gives zirv a
//! single, harness-neutral classification (`SafetyPolicy`, [`evaluate`]) that
//! every adapter then projects onto its own native mechanism, so one
//! operator setting produces equivalent behaviour everywhere -- the same
//! shape `policy.rs` already established for the seven-capability
//! `[policy]` table, applied here to concrete command strings instead of
//! abstract capabilities.
//!
//! ## Layering, and why it is not `ctx.toml`'s deep merge
//!
//! `[safety]` cannot use the ordinary deep merge (a later layer's array
//! would simply *replace* an earlier one's) or `REPO_FORBIDDEN`'s
//! all-or-nothing rejection (issue #83 requires a repo to be able to
//! *narrow* the policy -- add more `deny`/`ask` entries -- while never
//! widening it). So [`resolve`] folds the layers the way `policy::resolve`
//! folds `[policy]`, lifted whole out of `ctx.toml` by `config::CtxConfig::
//! load` before its own deep merge:
//!
//! - **`deny`/`ask`** are additive across layers: the built-in set (derived
//!   from `adapters::SHIPPED_POSTURE_ALLOW`/`_DENY`, the same live-verified
//!   claude posture PR #96 shipped) plus the operator's own `~/.zirv/
//!   ctx.toml` entries plus the repo's own `.zirv/ctx.toml` entries, all
//!   unioned. Adding a `deny`/`ask` entry can only ever make a command
//!   *stricter* to evaluate (deny and ask are both checked before allow --
//!   see [`evaluate`]), so a repo checkout contributing to either list is
//!   always safe, the identical reasoning `SandboxConfig::extra_deny`
//!   already uses.
//! - **`allow`** may be extended only by the operator's own home layer.
//!   `config.rs`'s `REPO_FORBIDDEN` table rejects a repo `ctx.toml` that
//!   sets `safety.allow` at all -- there is no narrowing reading of adding
//!   an allow entry (unlike `deny`/`ask`, evaluated *after* both), so it is
//!   forbidden outright rather than folded, mirroring `sandbox.extra_allow`.
//! - **`default`** (the verdict for a command matching nothing) is
//!   `REPO_FORBIDDEN` outright too, for the same reason: it is a single
//!   scalar with no narrowing direction of its own.
//! - **Environment** (`ZIRV_CTX_SAFETY_DENY`/`_ASK`/`_ALLOW`/`_DEFAULT`)
//!   sits above the fold and wins outright, the operator's own escape
//!   hatch, mirroring `ZIRV_CTX_SANDBOX_EXTRA_DENY`/`_ALLOW`. It replaces
//!   the operator+repo *contribution* to a list, never the built-in set
//!   itself: there is no environment variable that removes a built-in
//!   protection, only ones that add to or replace what an operator/repo
//!   contributed on top of it.
//!
//! ## The matcher is pure
//!
//! [`evaluate`] and [`glob_match`] read no clock, filesystem or
//! environment -- the same discipline `rot.rs` holds its scoring functions
//! to. [`resolve`] (the layering step, one level up) takes its environment
//! as an injected closure, exactly like `policy::resolve`, so it stays
//! deterministic and testable without touching real process state.
