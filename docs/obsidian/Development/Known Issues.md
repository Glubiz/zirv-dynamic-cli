# Known Issues

Gotchas that have cost debugging time. Remove an entry once it's resolved — this
file tracks live traps, not history (use [[Decision Log]] or [[Work Journal]]
for that).

Each entry gets a changelog comment at the top of the file, newest first:

## portable-pty's Windows `do_kill` inverts its own success check

`WinChild::do_kill` in portable-pty 0.9.0 (`src/win/mod.rs`, lines 41–50) reads:

```rust
let res = unsafe { TerminateProcess(proc.as_raw_handle() as _, 1) };
let err = IoError::last_os_error();
if res != 0 { Err(err) } else { Ok(()) }
```

Win32 `TerminateProcess` returns **non-zero on success**, so this reports a
successful kill as an error and a failed one as success. `ChildKiller::kill`
then swallows the result with `.ok()` anyway, so zirv never learns a kill
failed: `child.kill()` in `wrap::quit_child` always looks like it worked.

Do **not** vendor or patch portable-pty for this. Treat `kill()` as
best-effort and never build logic on its return value — `try_wait()` /
`wait_for_exit` are the only trustworthy evidence a child is actually gone,
and `quit_child` already keys on those.

## Never write a control byte into a pty master

Writing `\x03` (or any console control byte) into the pty master is not a
signal to *that one child*. On Windows the master is a ConPTY and conhost
turns the byte into a console control event broadcast to **every** process
attached to the pseudoconsole; portable-pty 0.9.0 spawns without
`CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP`, so there is no process group to narrow it to. On
unix the line discipline delivers SIGINT to the whole foreground process
group of that pty — better, but still not one process.

This is why `wrap::quit_child`'s ladder is quit sequence → grace →
`child.kill()` with nothing in between, and why the removed Ctrl-C rung must
not come back. See the [[Decision Log]] entry for 2026-08-13.

## An empty or very short `zirv ctx nudge` prefix is refused

`sessions::resolve_prefix` accepts any *unique* prefix, including `""`
(`starts_with("")` is always true). That is fine for a read-only lookup but
not for a nudge, which wakes and — in `exec` — restarts the session it
resolves to: a single mistyped character can still be unique. `zirv ctx
nudge` therefore refuses any prefix shorter than four characters
(`sessions::MIN_NUDGE_PREFIX`) unless it exactly equals a live session's
whole short id.

Test helpers that used to lean on the empty prefix (`exec`'s
`nudge_live_session`, `wrap`'s interactive-nudge test) now resolve the live
short id from the registry and pass it whole. A test that still passes `""`
fails with `prefix too short`, and — if its cleanup runs after the call —
can leak `FAKE_AGENT_*` environment variables into every later test in the
same process.

## `ctx` shadows `.zirv/ctx.yaml`

`zirv ctx` is a built-in resolved in `main.rs` before YAML script lookup, so a
`.zirv/ctx.yaml` script named `ctx` is silently shadowed and never runs.
`.zirv/ctx.toml` is a different file — it's the ctx config, and it's excluded
from script listing in `help.rs`.

## Tests must run with `--test-threads=1`

`cargo test --verbose -- --test-threads=1` is required, not optional — tests
share state (state dir, fixtures) and will flake or corrupt each other under
the default parallel test runner.

## `wrap`'s hot path assumes `panic = "abort"`

The release profile is `panic = "abort"`, so a panic on `wrap`'s hot path
cannot unwind to a cleanup handler — raw-mode terminal restore must happen in
explicit arms, not in a `Drop` guard relying on unwind. No `unwrap`/`expect` on
that path; any supervision failure must degrade to pure passthrough instead of
leaving the terminal in raw mode.
